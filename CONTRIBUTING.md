# Why
Recent history in some prominent open source projects demonstrates that there is an ongoing problem in creating inclusive open source communities where all members feel comfortable contributing their talents and efforts. Because open source work is often carried out on a volunteer basis, it is vital that potential contributors feel welcome and encouraged to do so. On a pragmatic level, this must be balanced with the high workload that project leaders and frequent contributors (sometimes called "core committers") face in maintaining open source projects. We believe a stronger, more valuable community and development process can be enabled by clear documentation and guidelines.
