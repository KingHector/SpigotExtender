### Color Method

Using ```ChatColor.COLOR ``` in your code is not the best way to add color to your Strings as it can get really obnoxious, 
especially if you want a multicolored one.

With the Color method you can use Minecraft's ColorCodes.

Example: ```player.sendMessage(processes.color("&cPhileasFogg3 is bad!"));```

Output: PhileasFogg3 is bad! (In red)
